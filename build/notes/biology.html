They are a subtype of glutamate receptors, as they are activated by the neurotransmitter glutamate, which is the primary excitatory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system. NMDA receptors are unique because they are both ligand-gated and voltage-dependent. This means they require the binding of glutamate and a change in the electrical potential of the cell membrane to become active.</p><h3 id="neurotransmitters">Neurotransmitters</h3><h4 id="excitatory-and-inhibitory-neurons">Excitatory and Inhibitory Neurons</h4><p>Neurons in the brain can be broadly classified into excitatory and inhibitory types based on the type of neurotransmitters they release and the effect they have on target neurons. Excitatory Neurons: These neurons release excitatory neurotransmitters, like glutamate, which increase the likelihood that the target neuron will fire an action.</p><h2 id="resources">Resources</h2><h3 id="molecular-biology-of-the-cell">Molecular Biology of the Cell</h3><p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK21054/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK21054/</a></p><h3 id="introduction-to-genomics-for-engineers">Introduction to Genomics for Engineers</h3><p><a href="https://learngenomics.dev/">https://learngenomics.dev/</a></p><h3 id="the-biostar-handbook">The Biostar Handbook</h3><p><a href="https://www.biostarhandbook.com/">https://www.biostarhandbook.com/</a></p></div></body></html>
