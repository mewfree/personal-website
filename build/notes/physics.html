These lectures are what got me into physics: my astronomy professor told me to read them and see if I liked physics - they changed my life! They are somewhat difficult to understand if you are just getting started, but they will make more and more sense by the time you reach levels 5 and 6 in the undergraduate curriculum."</p><h3 id="deep-down-things-the-breathtaking-beauty-of-particle-physics-by-bruce-schumm-level-difficult">Deep Down Things: The Breathtaking Beauty of Particle Physics by Bruce Schumm (Level: Difficult)</h3><p>"The very best popular book about particle physics ‚Äî it clearly explains the most difficult concepts without resorting to speculation. (I had the honor of working with Bruce on a search for supersymmetry at the ATLAS detector.) This book is a great read while you are starting level 7 in the undergraduate curriculum."</p></div></body></html>
