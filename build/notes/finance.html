Insurance seen as gambling/bets.</p><h4 id="insurance-is-a-local-phenomenon">Insurance is a Local Phenomenon</h4><p>Regulated for centuries. In the US, insurance is a local phenomenon. No national insurance companies, all state charters.</p><p>What protects you if the insurance company goes under? States started insurance guarantee funds. Similar to FDIC for banks.</p><p>Insurance for insurance. Usually quite limited.</p><p>AIG was bailed out during the 2008 financial crisis.

Penalty for individuals not buying insurance. Penalty for companies not offering insurance for their employees.</p><p>Not a great system because uninsured people show up to the Emergency Department and don't get any pre-emptive care.</p><h4 id="disasters">Disasters</h4><p>Most people in the world are not insured against earthquake risk.</p><p><code class="verbatim">Haiti Earthquake of 2010</code>: before the incident, there was a movement for Carribean countries to get insured.

The route would take 4-6 hours.</p><p>Then came the telegraph. Sped it up even more. Then came the beepers, and then the Internet.

Expected Utility Theory: everyone has a utility function, which depends on the things that they consume and it represents their happiness. People in a world with no uncertainty will choose how much to buy at the market prices to maximize their utility function. And if there's uncertainty, then people use the probabilities of possible events to calculate the expected utility and the maximized expected utility.</p><p>Kahnema and Tversky changes two things from expected utility theory:</p><ul><li>utility function =&gt; value function</li><li>probabilities =&gt; subjective probabilities determined by a weighting function in terms of the actual probabilities</li></ul><p>People are overly focused on little losses. People will often try to gamble out of losses.</p><h4 id="logical-fallacies">Logical Fallacies</h4><ol><li><p>Overconfidence</p><p>Most people think they're above average. Companies will hire CEOs from other companies to lead their companies, thinking they could reproduce the other company's success, but really it was all due to luck. People in business are overly influenced by the random successed of themselves or others.</p></li><li><p>Wishful thinking bias</p><p>People overestimate the probability of the things that they identify with and want to see happen. Can happen for sports team or political party/candidate.</p></li><li><p>Cognitive Dissonance</p><p>Mental conflicts that occurs when one learns one's beliefs are wrong. People who pick the wrong investment will forget about the performance of that investment.</p></li><li><p>Mental Compartments</p><p>People don't look at their whole portfolio. People have a "safe" part of their portfolio that they will not risk and a "risky" part of their portfolio that they can have fun with.</p></li><li><p>Attention Anomalies</p><p>You can't pay attention to everything. And some people would look at the stock market every day.</p><p>"No arbitrage assumption". No "free money".</p></li><li><p>Anchoring</p><p>A tendancy in ambiguous situations to allow one's decisions to be affected by some anchor.</p><p>Subjects are unaware of their own anchoring behaviour. Companies know that stock prices are anchored to past values. Also why companies like to do stock splits.</p></li><li><p>Representativeness Heuristic</p><p>People judge things by similarity to familiar types. Experiment: people were shown a woman with a description (sensitive, artistic) and were asked to guess their occupation between sculptress and bank teller. So many people chose scultpress even though there are so many more bank tellers. Tendency to see patterns in what is a really random walk.</p></li><li><p>Disjunction Effect</p><p>Inability to make decisions in advance in anticipation of future information. People don't anticipate their emotions later.</p></li><li><p>Magical Thinking</p><p>First described by B. F. Skinner in 1948, not using humans but pigeons. He fed hungry pigeons a single pellet of food every 15 seconds. Pigeons started doing weird things. They started doing the same thing they did right before the first pellet of food was dropped.</p><p>Stock market responses to events may have similar origins.</p></li><li><p>Quasi-Magical Thinking</p><p>Relates to Newcomb's Paradox. People vote. Why do they vote? The probability that the election would be won by 1 vote is very low. So people shouldn't vote. But people DO vote.</p><p>Ellen Langer: people bet more on coin not yet tossed. People pay more for lottery tickets in which they choose the number.</p></li><li><p>Culture and Social Contagion</p><p>Collective memory: we all remember the same facts and statistics, so we reach similar decisions.</p><p>There's a tendency for us to adopt beliefs of other people. There's a mathematical theory of disease epidemics that can be applied to speculative behaviour.</p><p>Moral anchors for the market in the form of human stories.</p></li><li><p>Antisocial Personality Disorder</p><p>== sociopathy Identity: egocentric, self-esteem from personal gain. Self-direction: absence of prosocial internal standards. Lack of empthy, incapacity for intimacy. Manipulative, deceitful, callous, hostile. Irresponsible, impulsive, risk-taking.</p></li><li><p>Borderline Personality Disorder</p><p>Instability of interpersonal relationships and self image.

Looming failure of PMIs, PMI Group Inc. declared bankruptcy in 2011.</p><h4 id="collateralized-mortgage-obligations-cmos">Collateralized Mortgage Obligations (CMOs)</h4><p>A pool of mortgages sold to investors. CMOs divide the cash flow of a mortgage pass-through security into a number of tranches in terms of prepayment risk.

During a bank run, everybody goes to the bank and demand their money at the same time. Depositors lose faith in the bank, and the bank runs out of money. Banks can't handle this.</p><p>Regulators in the US and other countries imposed reserve requirements. Banks have to keep a certain amount of cash in reserve to meet any sudden increase in demand from their depositors.</p><p>Excess reserves are the reserves that banks hold beyond what they're required to hold by regulation. Banks typically don't like that as it means they're getting 0% interest. But starting from the Great Recession (2008), central banks cut interest as much as they could (to 0% or even negative). Regulation has also made it more difficult for the banks to make risky loans. Therefore, banks started increasing their excess reserves.</p><h3 id="the-real-estate-bubble-and-origins-of-the-2008-financial-crisis">The Real Estate Bubble and Origins of the 2008 Financial Crisis</h3><p>Overoptimistic mortgage lending.
