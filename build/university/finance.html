Expected Utility Theory: everyone has a utility function, which depends on the things that they consume and it represents their happiness. People in a world with no uncertainty will choose how much to buy at the market prices to maximize their utility function. And if there's uncertainty, then people use the probabilities of possible events to calculate the expected utility and the maximized expected utility.</p><p>Kahnema and Tversky changes two things from expected utility theory:</p><ul><li>utility function =&gt; value function</li><li>probabilities =&gt; subjective probabilities determined by a weighting function in terms of the actual probabilities</li></ul><p>People are overly focused on little losses. People will often try to gamble out of losses.</p><h4 id="logical-fallacies">Logical Fallacies</h4><ol><li><p>Overconfidence</p><p>Most people think they're above average. Companies will hire CEOs from other companies to lead their companies, thinking they could reproduce the other company's success, but really it was all due to luck. People in business are overly influenced by the random successed of themselves or others.</p></li><li><p>Wishful thinking bias</p><p>People overestimate the probability of the things that they identify with and want to see happen.

People who pick the wrong investment will forget about the performance of that investment.</p></li><li><p>Mental Compartments</p><p>People don't look at their whole portfolio. People have a "safe" part of their portfolio that they will not risk and a "risky" part of their portfolio that they can have fun with.</p></li><li><p>Attention Anomalies</p><p>You can't pay attention to everything. And some people would look at the stock market every day.</p><p>"No arbitrage assumption". No "free money".</p></li><li><p>Anchoring</p><p>A tendancy in ambiguous situations to allow one's decisions to be affected by some anchor.</p><p>Subjects are unaware of their own anchoring behaviour. Companies know that stock prices are anchored to past values. Also why companies like to do stock splits.</p></li><li><p>Representativeness Heuristic</p><p>People judge things by similarity to familiar types. Experiment: people were shown a woman with a description (sensitive, artistic) and were asked to guess their occupation between sculptress and bank teller. So many people chose scultpress even though there are so many more bank tellers. Tendency to see patterns in what is a really random walk.</p></li><li><p>Disjunction Effect</p><p>Inability to make decisions in advance in anticipation of future information. People don't anticipate their emotions later.</p></li><li><p>Magical Thinking</p><p>First described by B. F. Skinner in 1948, not using humans but pigeons. He fed hungry pigeons a single pellet of food every 15 seconds. Pigeons started doing weird things. They started doing the same thing they did right before the first pellet of food was dropped.</p><p>Stock market responses to events may have similar origins.</p></li><li><p>Quasi-Magical Thinking</p><p>Relates to Newcomb's Paradox. People vote. Why do they vote? The probability that the election would be won by 1 vote is very low. So people shouldn't vote. But people DO vote.</p><p>Ellen Langer: people bet more on coin not yet tossed. People pay more for lottery tickets in which they choose the number.</p></li><li><p>Culture and Social Contagion</p><p>Collective memory: we all remember the same facts and statistics, so we reach similar decisions.</p><p>There's a tendency for us to adopt beliefs of other people. There's a mathematical theory of disease epidemics that can be applied to speculative behaviour.</p><p>Moral anchors for the market in the form of human stories.</p></li><li><p>Antisocial Personality Disorder</p><p>== sociopathy Identity: egocentric, self-esteem from personal gain. Self-direction: absence of prosocial internal standards. Lack of empthy, incapacity for intimacy. Manipulative, deceitful, callous, hostile. Irresponsible, impulsive, risk-taking.</p></li><li><p>Borderline Personality Disorder</p><p>Instability of interpersonal relationships and self image.
