They're accessible from the top menu or <a href="/notes">directly from this link</a>.</p><p>There are close to 80 different pages, some longer than others (<a href="/notes/computer-science">Computer Science</a>, <a href="/notes/finance">Finance</a>, <a href="/notes/psychology">Psychology</a>‚Ä¶). Quality (and quantity) varies a lot depending on my knowledge of the subject.</p><p>I've been gathering them privately over the past few years and decided that there were no reasons to keep them private and not making them available to anybody online.</p><h2 id="why-take-so-many-notes">Why take so many notes?</h2><h3 id="task-tracking">Task tracking</h3><p>It all started with task tracking. If you work at a software company, you've probably used Kanban boards before.</p><p>Everybody need to track tasks of some sorts. Most people probably manage just right with their memory only. But sometimes it gets a bit too complicated and you need to write your own little to-dos, outside of work.</p><p>For me, this manifested the most during immigration processes (like applying for a new work permit) or when moving between apartments (switching utility providers, telling everybody who has your address that it changed, tracking deposits/first month of rent‚Ä¶).</p><h3 id="journaling-onset">Journaling onset</h3><p>In August of 2019, I had a bike accident that resulted in a concussion. I was so afraid of memory loss that I felt the urge to document everything.</p><p>To be fair, this habit had started a few days before that, but the post-concussion syndrome symptoms really made me stick to it, to an even greater extent.</p><p>I had started journaling using <a href="#notion">Notion</a> just a few days before the accident. I believe I had initially heard colleagues starting to use Notion internally to manage their team's documents. I tried it myself and was instantly hooked.</p><p>I have the tendency to not keep up with those habits (tried journaling with <a href="https://jrnl.sh/">jrnl.sh</a> in the past and quickly abandoned). If it wasn't for my accident, I probably would have never stuck with either journaling or <a href="#notion">Notion</a>.</p><p>I'm getting close to 1,000 daily journal entries now, so I will probably write a dedicated blog post about my journaling practice, but it is closely linked to my note taking experience.</p><h3 id="second-brain">"Second brain"</h3><p>So we have task tracking, journaling‚Ä¶ What else is missing? Well, according to me‚Ä¶ Everything else.</p><p>Let's say you watch an interesting YouTube video or read a fascinating book. What do you do with the knowledge that you just acquired?</p><p>You're reading a programming tutorial and trying to wrap your head around a new concept‚Ä¶ What do you do so you can efficient learn about this new concept and remember about it the next day?</p><p>Again, most people probably don't take any notes and try to remember everything by heart, but this is quite inefficient. There is value in having everything at one place, written in your own words.</p><h2 id="why-publish-them-online">Why publish them online?</h2><p>I've had this idea of creating my own personal "university" for a while. The term "university" is a bit pompous so I decided to simply name it "<a href="/notes">notes</a>" because it's basically what it is.</p><p>A more or less organized network of notes on subjects that are usually taught by universities. But there is very little research, no assignments, no knowledge check‚Ä¶</p><p>Nowadays, knowledge is easily available, often free and constantly changing. Education should never stops.</p><p>The main target audience of those notes is‚Ä¶ me! I mainly do this for myself and only decided to publish them because it was so easy to export them to <a href="/notes/computer-science/languages#html">HTML</a>.</p><h2 id="introduction-to-personal-knowledge-management-pkm">Introduction to Personal Knowledge Management (PKM)</h2><h3 id="what-is-pkm">What is PKM?</h3><p>The concept behind Personal Knowledge Management is that everyone should have their own organized thoughts around the topics they want.</p><h3 id="why-do-pkm">Why do PKM?</h3><p>The benefits that I personally see are:</p><ul><li>Easy to <strong>search</strong>: because it's just text files locally on your computer, you're able to search through them very efficiently and recover data faster than through external search engines</li><li><strong>Learning</strong> by writing: it is scientifically proven that writing down notes helps with memorization</li><li><strong>Organizing</strong> your thoughts as you wish: you can fully customize your own notes</li><li>Discovering <strong>links</strong>: I think this is a bit oversold, but some people really seem to dig the idea of finding "patterns" or "links" between domains / ideas that are being explored through these tools</li></ul><h3 id="modern-tools-used-for-pkm">Modern tools used for PKM</h3><h4 id="notion"><a href="https://www.notion.so/">Notion</a></h4><blockquote><p>One workspace.</p><p>Every team.</p><p>We‚Äôre more than a doc.

I would go sit in the class, look at the slides, actively listen to the Professor and try to remember as much as possible. When it was time to take the exam, I would simply go over the slides again and try to re-do the exercises.</p><h3 id="trello-google-keep"><a href="https://trello.com/">Trello</a> &amp; <a href="https://keep.google.com/">Google Keep</a></h3><p>I had a love-hate relationship with Trello.</p><p>I first hated Trello, but quickly realized when I first started to use it by and for myself, that I wasn't hating Trello. I was hating on how little control I had over it when I was using it at my job.</p><p>I since made peace with Trello and used it for a while for more organized tasks / projects.</p><p>Google Keep was used for quick notes, especially good on mobile. Being able to take quick notes on mobile is very important to me.</p><h3 id="notion-1"><a href="#notion">Notion</a></h3><p>As we saw earlier I started using <a href="#notion">Notion</a> a few years ago. It is an excellent tool and I really enjoy using it. This is still what I use whenever I need to work on something collaboratively with other people.</p><p>It finally allowed me to combine Trello, Google Keep, and even a little bit of Google Spreadsheets and Google Calendar, all in one very well designed tool.</p><p>But I had some issues on keeping personal data hosted there and their availability in case of outages (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/12/notion-outage-dns-domain-issues/">like dreaded DNS issues</a>).</p><h3 id="obsidian-gitjournal"><a href="#obsidian">Obsidian</a> &amp; <a href="https://gitjournal.io/">GitJournal</a></h3><p>Liked that I was able to use plain text files (potentially encrypted) and that I could them sync using <a href="/notes/computer-science/git">Git</a>.</p><p>Having a <a href="/notes/computer-science/text-editors/vim">vim</a>-mode plugin available was also greatly appreciated.</p><p>For mobile, I was using <a href="https://gitjournal.io/">GitJournal</a> as <a href="#obsidian">Obsidian</a> mobile apps were not available at the time, which works really great!</p><p>But I still felt like something was missing‚Ä¶</p><h3 id="org-mode-using-emacs"><a href="/notes/computer-science/text-editors/emacs/org-mode">Org-mode</a> using <a href="/notes/computer-science/text-editors/emacs">Emacs</a></h3><p>Now we're getting to <a href="/notes/computer-science/text-editors/emacs/org-mode">Org-mode</a>.
