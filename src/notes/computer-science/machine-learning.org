* Deep Learning
** Quantization
Process of reducing the number of bits (weights and biases) of a model/neural network.
The primary goal is to compress the model in size for faster execution/computation without sacrificing too much in terms of accuracy.
** LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)
Efficient training method by creating and updating low-rank approximations of the original weight matrices (update matrices).
