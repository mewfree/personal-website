*** Quantization
Process of reducing the number of bits (weights and biases) of a model/neural network.
The primary goal is to compress the model in size for faster execution/computation without sacrificing too much in terms of accuracy.
*** LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)
Efficient training method by creating and updating low-rank approximations of the original weight matrices (update matrices).

*** Neural Networks: Zero to Hero
#+begin_quote
A course by Andrej Karpathy on building neural networks, from scratch, in code.
We start with the basics of backpropagation and build up to modern deep neural networks, like GPT. In my opinion language models are an excellent place to learn deep learning, even if your intention is to eventually go to other areas like computer vision because most of what you learn will be immediately transferable. This is why we dive into and focus on languade models.
Prerequisites: solid programming (Python), intro-level math (e.g. derivative, gaussian).
