**** Getting into VC and Staying in VC
As a partner: no application, all about connections (example: founded a successful company, early portfolio company...)
Analyst / associate: after business school
Always Be Closing or you'll be booted from the next fund

**** Dynamics of Negotiating A Financing Round
***** Convincing founders
Assume it's a really good company
Never show any dislike or distaste
You never know if this founder is gonna start the next billion-dollar company
Their first idea might be terrible, they second idea might be wonderful

Keep an open mind, be very friendly and positive to the founder in addition to pitching your partnership / your firm
Start your reputation (demo day...) before you even meet a founder for the first time

***** Convincing the rest of your partnership
Max 2-3 deals per year (major (>20%) deals with a seat on the board)

You might see hundreds a deal, have 8-10 that you might fund and at the end of year you typically fund 2 or 3 deals
For each of the hundreds of deal that you see, it might be one of the 8-10 and you'll want to fund
VC firm is a partnership, need to convince the other partners, deals are usually a consensus between all the partners

***** Competitive deals
Always assume it'll be competitive and that many other funds will want to invest
You either want to be in really early (first term sheet) or very late (last term sheet)

**** Sourcing Deals and Finding Investment Opportunities
***** Sourcing Deals
Data-driven approach:
- Who's raising in App Stores rankings?
- Who's raising in Alexa ratings for top sites?

Attending demo days at incubators, accelerators..

- Anything available on the Internet or at a demo day: you're not the only one looking at it
- Make sure you have your network in place
- The best VC firms know all the companies at YC demo day before they even present

***** Best Investment Opportunities
- Tech (is there a strong product?)
- Team (what's the founders track record? evidence that they have a vision? an idea is cheap, it's about how you execute it)
- Product/Market Fit (is this actually a need that's being met? 100% of 10M market < 1% of $1B market)

**** Term Sheet Basics
***** Pre and Post-Money Valuation
- A company has $3M worth of assets
- An investor comes in and put $1M in the company
- Pre-Money Valuation is $3M
- Post-Money Valuation is $4M

***** Liquidation Preference
Preferred Stocks vs Common Stocks
- With Preferred Stocks, investors get their money back first
- It only really matters when a company sells for below their valuation price
- Snap has investors holding common stocks but this is very uncommon

***** Board of Directors
With a significant amount of capital usually comes a board seat

Common board for early stage companies:
- Founder
- Lead Investor
- Independant Board Member

For later stage companies:
- Co-Founder
- Co-Founder
- Lead Investor #1
- Lead Investor #2
- Independant Board Member

Goal of the board is to guide the CEO and hold them accountable

***** Protective Provisions
For example, approval of board before any X amount of capital spent

***** Right of First Refusal (ROFR)
As an investor, if a company is selling secondary shares, you'll be able to purchase those shares before anybody else

***** Pro Rata
The right of keeping a % of the company shares in later financing rounds by adding capital and not being diluted

***** Drag Along
As a lead investor, drag along means that you make all major business decisions for all the smaller (typically angel) investors

***** Employee Option Pool
VCs prefer that the employee option pool is created before their investment (typically 15-20%, diluting the founders)
Best entrepreneurs refer that the employee option pool is created after the round of investment, diluting everybody

***** No Shop Agreement
Usually 40 days (VCs want it longer (60-90 days) and entrepreneurs shorters (30 days))
Means you're not shopping around the term sheet / valuation (otherwise process never ends)
Term sheets aren't binding, though usually everybody goes through the deal as your reputation is on the line

**** Portfolio Management
3 types of companies in a typical portfolio:
- unicorns, $1B outcome
- dragonites, potential to have a high ROI
- the walking dead, consistently operating but probably won't make a huge exit for you

VCs would typically focus on the top 2-3 companies in their portfolio of ~10

Walking dead strategies:
- Being an activist: Sequoia merged Elon Musk's X.com and Peter Thiel's company creating PayPal
- Ignoring it

**** VC Firm Composition, Governance and Dynamics
Every VC firm has those four roles:
- Analysis and Market Research
- Sourcing
- Investments and Portfolio Management
- Fund Raising

The more senior you are, the more towards sourcing, investment and fund raising you are

Generally speaking, towards the beginning of the life of the fund, that's where the investments that are true to the spirit of the fund are made
In the middle, that's when the crazy investments are made
And towards the end, investments are made very carefully as it might impact being able to raide for the next fund

**** GP / LP Dynamics
- GP = General Partners
- LP = Limited Partners

- LPs invest in VC funds
- High net worth individuals, corporations, institutional investors, universities...

- Every VC fund is a partnership, is there good synergy between the partners?
- What's their investment thesis/strategy? Particular sector?
- Are the GPs well suited to source and close investments?

- Typically a 2-3% management fee
- $100M fund, $2-3M for the GP to manage the fund
- Other: 20% carried interest => 80/20 split of profits
- $1B fund, LPs get $800M, GPs get $200M

* Clients Relationships
How to handle clients in a freelancing / agency relationship?
- https://leanpub.com/freelancedeveloperbook
- It's a relationship like any other, and you earn each other trust through your interactions over time. So you need to be extremely reliable and responsive if you want to be perceived as trust worthy.
- If something bad happened, be transparent and the sooner you say it the better. It's extremely uncomfortable, and you'll try to delay it because you don't want to say shit happened, even if it wasn't your fault.
- Never bring up a problem without a solution, or a potential solution, or a recommendation for a solution. No one wants problems, we all have plenty of those. Even if it's something out of your control, you should always spin a solution for it.
- Always reply, never leave someone hanging.
